# Scala List Extended

This little project contains extension methods for Scala List
(like *intersperse* and *intercalate*) which Haskell provides in
it's List implementation and Scala doesn't provide in the
standard library.

The inspiration for this project came from reading the online
version of "Learn You Haskell for Great Good!" by Miran Lipovaca.

The Haskell list functions which I translate to Scala are described here:

http://learnyouahaskell.com/modules#data-list

and as well in Haskell's docs for *Data.List*:
